# Hello there,
## This is a package for electrophysiology data that determines the firing rate (and a few other parameters relavent too!)
## First, we will install this package then bring in the example data provided
```{r}
library(firingr8)
input <- "/"
indentifiers <- "/"
```

## There is only one function which will require electrophysiology data, an identifier dataset to determine which cell it is, and a selected output
```{r}
process_ephys_csv(input, indentifiers, "/")

```

## Now, go check your desktop to see the out put!
#Here is an example of the CSV file. 
```{r}
#filepath of output that we made


```
